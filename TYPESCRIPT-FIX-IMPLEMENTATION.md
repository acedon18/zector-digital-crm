# TypeScript Fix Implementation

## Overview

As part of our ongoing effort to improve code quality and maintainability, we've addressed TypeScript errors in the tracking server component. This document outlines the fixes implemented and the remaining challenges.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Express Route Handler TypeScript Fixes

The main issue in `trackingServer.ts` was incorrect typing for Express route handlers. This has been fixed by:

- Using properly typed `Request` and `Response` objects from Express
- Converting `async/await` handlers to promise chain patterns where appropriate
- Implementing proper type definitions for request parameters

Before:
```typescript
app.post('/track', async (req, res) => {
  // Implementation using async/await
});
```

After:
```typescript
app.post('/track', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // Implementation using promise chains for better TypeScript compatibility
});
```

### 2. Properly Typed MongoDB Queries

We've replaced `any` types with proper interfaces:

- Created a `CompanyQuery` interface for MongoDB queries
- Created a `SortOptions` interface for MongoDB sort operations
- Used these interfaces instead of `any` type

Before:
```typescript
const query: any = {};
let sortOptions: any = {};
```

After:
```typescript
const query: CompanyQuery = {};
const sortOptions: SortOptions = {};
```

## Remaining Challenges

1. **Express Type Definitions Compatibility**: Even with the fixed version, there are still some TypeScript errors regarding Express route handler compatibility. These issues appear to be related to TypeScript's handling of the Express typings.

2. **Import.meta Usage**: Several service files use `import.meta.env` for environment variables, which is Vite-specific and not compatible with TypeScript's CommonJS compilation mode. This needs refactoring to use `process.env` or a compatible environment variable system.

3. **Module Path Aliases**: TypeScript can't resolve the `@/types/leads` import path in services.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Service Files**: Modify service files to use Node.js compatible environment variable access (`process.env` instead of `import.meta.env`).

2. **Module Resolution**: Fix the path resolution for `@/types/leads` imports.

3. **Express TypeScript Plugin**: Consider using a more specialized Express TypeScript plugin or typings that better support async route handlers.

4. **Backend/Frontend Code Separation**: In the long term, consider better separation between backend and frontend code to allow appropriate TypeScript configurations for each context.

## Conclusion

The current implementation represents a significant improvement, eliminating many TypeScript errors and providing a stronger type foundation. However, complete TypeScript integration will require addressing the remaining issues noted above.

This incremental approach allows us to gradually improve type safety while maintaining functionality.
